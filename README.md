# AKSA-BE

This time I got a project to create a simple API

- Features
  - Show => total books that will show in the page
  - Page => total page are available
  - SortBy => sorting books by their field
  - OrderBy => ordering book by ASC or DESC

## How to using

For this API, I haven't had the chance to deploy it, for some reason. For how to try it, you just clone this repo and try it on your postman or something similar.

<br />
And to run it you just need to run the command below 
<br />

```bash
npm install //To install an existing package
```
<br />

```bash
nodemon app.js //To running server
```
